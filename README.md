# typora-academic-forked

A forked version of the [academic
theme](https://github.com/typora/typora-theme-gallery/blob/gh-pages/_posts/theme/2018-01-07-Academic.md)
for [Typora](https://typora.io/), a wonderful text editor. Many adjustments are made
based on personal preferences.

## Adjustments made

1. Default font size is set to `16px`. On the contrary, the sizes of various headlines were set smaller.

2. Added headline-level indicators to each headline. The code that does this was
   borrowed from the
   [ursine-polar](https://github.com/aCluelessDanny/typora-theme-ursine) theme, and
   hence the indicators look exactly the same as they are in Ursine.

3. Task list items marked as done will be stricken through. Code that does this is
   borrowed from the [panda](https://github.com/gilbertohasnofb/typora-panda-theme)
   theme.

## Notes

- I did not run tests on this fork as it has been for my personal use only. May test it later.
